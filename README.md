This operating system is designed to run on low power embedded devices. It has a 
pre-emptive scheduling algorithm and offers a POSIX like interface to the apps.


## Building

Download the sources with git clone and update the submodules
for this project:

```
git clone https://github.com/sebastianene07/calypso_os.git
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Example for building Calypso OS for Norfic NRF5X board:

```
make config MACHINE_TYPE=nrf5x/nrf52840
make -j
```
or if we have nrf52832:
```
make config MACHINE_TYPE=nrf5x/nrf52832
make -j
```

You can enable different features for your board by using the Kconfig
menu selection.

```
make menuconfig
```

The above command requires you to have ``` kconfig-mconf ``` installed on your 
build machine.

## Current features

### 1. Task scheduling and basic synchronization primitives

The OS defines two list :

g_tcb_waiting_list - is holding the tasks in one of the following states:&nbsp;
                     [READY, WAITING_FOR_SEM, HALT] &nbsp;

g_tcb_list         - is holding the tasks in the READY and RUNNING state &nbsp;

The g_current_tcb pointer points to the current running task. &nbsp;
A task transitions from running to waiting for semaphore &nbsp;
when it tries to acquire a semaphore that has a value <= 0. &nbsp;
The task is placed in the g_tcb_waiting_list and it's context &nbsp;
is saved on the stack. &nbsp;

To wakeup a task from the waiting for semaphore state &nbsp;
someone has to call ```sem_post``` on the semaphore &nbsp;
that keeps the task from running. Once this semaphore &nbsp;
is posted, the task enters the READY state and when the &nbsp;
Idle Task runs it moves the task from the g_tcb_waiting_list &nbsp;
to g_tcb_list list. &nbsp;

### 2. Dynamic memory allocation

The allocator is implemented as part of a submodule in s_alloc. It can be
configure to run with multipple heap objects depending on the needs.
It supports the following operations: s_alloc, s_free, s_realloc
and the code is tested in a sample program (main.c) that verify the integrity
of the allocated blocks and monitors the fragmentation. The test also 
verifies that the allocated regions do not overlap.
In the current configuration it supports up to 2 ^ 31 - 1 blocks of memory
where the block size is defined by the code that it's using the allocator.
The allocation is done in O(N) space time (searching through the list of free
nodes) whereas the free operation can take O(N^2) because of the block merging
and sorting. 

### 3. Virtual File System

The virtual file system contains a tree like structure with nodes that allows
us to interract with the system resources. The current nodes are:

```              root node
                    "/"
             --------------------
           |    |    |    |    |
          dev  mnt  bin  otp  home
       /   |  \
 ttyUSB0  rtc0 spi0
```

A task contains a list of ```struct opened_resource_s``` which is essentially
the struct file from Linux and has the same role.
The registered nodes in the virtual file sytem are described by
``` struct vfs_node_s ``` and these keep informations such as:
- device type
- supported operations
- name
- private data

The open device flow:

```
open(..) -> vfs_get_matching_node(..) -------
            /\                              |
         Extract the node from the VFS      |
         and call into ops open_cb(..)      |
                                            |
                                      sched_allocate_resource() -----
                                      /\                            |
                               Allocate a new opened_resource_s     |
                               in the calling process.              |
                               Return the index of the              |
                               opened_resource_s structure as       |
                               the file descriptor.                 |
                                                                    |
                -----------------------------------------------------
                |-> vfs_node_open()
                      /\
                   Call the appropriate node open function.
```

## TODO's

## Porting Guide 

Run the script to add a new board:
```
user:~/calypso_os/$ ./add_board.sh
do you wish to create a new board [Y/y/n] ?
y
Yes
what name has the board ?
awesome_board
Confirm board name awesome_board [Y/y/n] ?
y
what arch is the board [arm sim template xtensa] ?
x86
ARCH x86 is new. Confirm adding it [Y/y/n] ?
y
Creating board in: arch/x86/awesome_board
Creating config entry in: config/awesome_board
Done !
```

After this, there are a bunch of filed generated from the template. This files
contains sources, makefiles and Kconfig options. A good place to start is to
edit the memory layout in the config/${board_name}/scripts/linker.ld
The next step is to specify the CROSS COMPILER PREFIX from the defconfig.
Check out the board
interface defined here: https://github.com/sebastianene07/calypso_os/tree/master/config

To implement the minimum support, define and use the functions marked as
```MANDATORY```.
